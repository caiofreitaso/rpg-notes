#sorcerer-king

Born Borys of Ebe, the Dragon was once a Champion's captain, elevated by [[Rajaat]] after his master Egendo was captured and killed by dwarves.

His most loyal subjects are the [[Kaisharga]], or the Dead Lords.

## Rebellion
Borys discovered Rajaat's plans to betray humanity and reverse the Rebirth, so he gathered the other Champions to strike against their master. Two Champions still helped Rajaat escape while the others fought him: [[Sacha]] and [[Wyan]]. They attacked the Rebellion with the help of the silent halflings, but the two Champions were killed and the halflings thrown into the Black.

[[Nibenay|Gallard, Bane of Gnomes]] worked on a spell to banish Rajaat, but it would need some way to keep him imprisoned and [[The Dragon|Borys]] volunteered for the role of prison warden. To help with this role, [[Dregoth]] taught the Champions the spell for dragonhood. All Champions cast the spell, turning them into sorcerer-kings. To seal Rajaat, the Champions turned [[The Dragon|Borys]] into a full dragon. However, the process was too much and [[The Dragon]]'s mind was lost, full of anger, pain, and hunger.

The Champions fled and fortified their cities against the new threat they unleashed onto the world.
