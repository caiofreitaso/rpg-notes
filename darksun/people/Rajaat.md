Rajaat, aka The First Sorcerer, was a Pyreen born close to [[The Pristine Tower]]. Because of that, his body represented the worst features of the Rebirth races: very deformed and ugly, blessed with an incredible intellect.

His deeds changed both [[Athas]] and its sun, scorching the land forever.

## Early Life
He did not accept his features, so he researched into the past which led him to the [[Jagged Cliffs]]. In the time he spent there, Rajaat learned life-shaping and the two distinct ways of arcane magic: preserving and defiling. He defiled the whole forest trying to cure his condition, which caused it to turn into a wasted swamp with mutational energies.

During the time after this failure, Rajaat retreated to [[The Pristine Tower]] and made plans for a final solution to the Rebirth races. He started teaching preserving arcane magic and psionics to everyone, regardless of race or social class. In secret, he was teaching defiling magic to a handful of students, to discover which ones would take most quickly to defiling. Eventually, Rajaat stopped teaching.

## Preserver Jihad
Rajaat collected his best students and told them the preservers had betrayed him by using their magic to gain power over others and they would misuse their power until all of Athas was under their control. With these lies, Rajaat started the Preserver Jihad.

It started with covert assassinations of influential preservers. However, opposition formed and it was escalated to an open war. Any city or town that sheltered preservers became target to Rajaat's wrath.

This war brought the number of preservers down: effectively preserving magic was lost.

## Cleansing Wars
With defiling magic being predominant in [[Athas]], Rajaat's wrath turned into the Rebirth races. He gathered the fifteen members of his inner circle in [[The Pristine Tower]], with strange halfling followers. After they exited the Tower, the yellow sun turned crimson and had grown. For each Champion, Rajaat gave an army and a race to exterminate.

Each Champion fought their genocidal wars in their own way. Regardless of their methods, [[Athas]]' races were never the same. Trolls were lost. No pixie was ever born since then. Only the magical mutations of ogres are left. Lizardmen were obliterated by the spell that eventually turned the Sunrise Sea into silt. Elves left their cities and became nomadic. This was not always in favor of the Champions, as the dwarves captured and killed a Champion.

Eventually, all Champions settled as leaders of cities: either rising to power or conquering a city.

## Rebellion
[[The Dragon|Borys of Ebe]] discovered Rajaat's plans to betray humanity and reverse the Rebirth, so he gathered the other Champions to strike against their master. Two Champions still helped Rajaat escape while the others fought him: [[Sacha]] and [[Wyan]]. They attacked the Rebellion with the help of the silent halflings, but the two Champions were killed and the halflings thrown into the Black.

With the help of [[Nibenay|Gallard, Bane of Gnomes]] and [[The Dragon|Borys]], the Champions imprisoned Rajaat in the Hollow, beyond the Black.
