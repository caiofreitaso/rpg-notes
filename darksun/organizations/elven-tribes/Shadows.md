#elven-tribe 

- Spies, assassins, traders
- Operates all over the [[Tablelands]]

## 1. Talons
The Shadows are divided into cells called talons, based in each city. Each talon is led by a patriarch or matriarch (talon-master).

Once every 10 years, talon-masters meet to select the Grand Shadow Master, who can appoint and remove talon-masters.

## 2. Claws
Each talon is divided into sections for different activities

### 2.1. Mercenary Claw
- They use their own history, heraldry, and uniforms.

### 2.2. Magical Claw
- Defilers (mostly illusionists)
- Almost always assigned to support other claws
- Also operate as mages-for-hire

### 2.3. Thieving Claw
- 100 gp for difficult assignments
- Up to Â½ the item value after the job is done.

### 2.4. Espionage Claw
- Trade on information
- Shadows can get revenge if the information will be used for evil, or selfish purposes, or to harm the innocent

### 2.5. Raiding Claw
- Raid caravan traffic.
- Employers don't get the plunder.
- Pay depends on the target:
	- Lucrative targets cost less
	- Poorer victims cost more

### 2.6. Merchant Claw
- Buy and sell anything, anywhere, to anyone
- Prices depend on Shadows' attitude toward the individual
- Refuse to deal with sorcerer-monarchs and their templars
- Operate in normal elven markets, usually in the guise of the tribe that hosts the market
