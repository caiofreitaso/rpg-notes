Follow GURPS description
- Ships have **Hit Points**
- Armour gives **Damage Reduction**
- Shields give **Penalty to Hit**
- Weapons have **Armour Piercing Factor** (armour divisor)
### Damage Steps
1. Calculate probability of a hit
	- [[Shield]] and [[Jammer]] decrease probability
	- [[Sensors]] and [[Homing Command]] increase probability
	- Ship hull increases probability as the size increases
1. Check if weapon dealt damage
2. **Damage Reduction** is divided by the **Armour Piercing Factor**
3. Subtract the resulting Damage Reduction from the damage
4. Resulting damage is subtracted from  the current Hit Points
