Movement of any element in the [[Star Map]] is determined by the final acceleration and the initial speed of the object.
### Deceleration
- [[Race]]'s Acceleration Tolerance determines how fast a given colonisation ship may decelerate prior to descent.
	- Any [[Space Ship]] from a [[Race]] with [[Only Manned Ships]] has the same restriction
- [[Debris]] have no acceleration, only moment of inertia
- A [[Mineral Packet]] can decelerate at maximum jerk
### Engagement
- In order to engage with another fleet, the engaging fleet must match the other's speed and acceleration, both in magnitude and direction.
- A full battle occurs, with multiple turns for each fleet.
##### One-Way Interception
- If both fleets only cross paths in a single point, each fleet only gets one salvo against the other.
- This may occur when the intercepting fleet cannot decelerate in time.
