Protection against [[Laser]].
- Power beyond threshold deals full damage.
- Power under threshold is reduced by the absorption rate (damage is reduced by X%).
- Multiple instances of shield increase power threshold per new instance.
- Multiple instances of shield increase the absorption rate per new instance.
