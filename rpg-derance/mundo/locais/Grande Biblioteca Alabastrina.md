```
Selûne guides us through the night.
She is the moon, the stars her tears.
Her sister tries to douse her light,
But she protects us from our fears.

Shar will take your sorrow from you
But beware: her night is dark.
She'll hide your pain, and secrets, too.
And all your joy, and all your spark.

Silvanus, god of all that's wild.
Of nature's danger and its charm.
His glory's not to be defiled,
Or you yourself will come to harm.
```
